      <h3>For 600 years, the Tarot has been a symbol of guidance and wisdom. Its cards have been used to guide a pathway
        for a society, a way of life, and a way of thinking. The Tarot is a metaphysical tool that can provide clarity
        and insight to the world around us.</h3>
      <br><br>
      <p>
        Tarot from the beginning of its time has been considered esoteric until very recently. It has been
        ultimately misunderstood as some form of witch craft or magic but infact is deemed as a helping hand from the
        higher self of the user or seeker.
        <br><br>
        Noticably, during the pandemic Tarot and Divination had become more sociablly acceptable making it appear on
        most
        forms of social media.
        Many people stated that the phenomena was a period of enlightenment under the cirrcumstances.

    <div id="tribute-info-2">
      Since Tarot has been reiterated back into recognition, I would like to state some basic facts and maybe even some
      observations for anyone who is interested in beginning a journey of Tarot.
      <br><br>
      <h5><em>
          -Tarot is called Taromancy, its an art of divination<br><br>
          -There are 3 widely known types of Tarot decks. The Marseille,the Thoth and the Rider Waite-Smith deck.
          <br><br>
          -The Marseille deck was the first deck created for divination in the 18th century, even though many decks came
          before it.<br><br>
          -The Thoth deck was created by Allister Crowley and Illustrated by Frieda Harris who was a student of
          Crowely's.
          The deck was released in 1944.<br><br>
          -The Rider Waite-Smith deck is the most popular deck in the world and was published in 1909 in London.<br><br>
          -There are 4 ways to shuffle your Tarot deck.<br><br>
          -You should have a grounding ritual, an openning ritual and a closing ritual.<br><br>
          -The grounding ritual is the ritual that should be done first in order to focus your energy and clear any
          negativity.<br><br>
          -During, before and after the rituals you can cleanse your space for extra protection against negative
          energies.<br><br>
          -It is your choice to let the inquirer touch your cards, the cards should be cleansed after they are handled
          by another person.<br><br>
          -You have the choice to use crystals to enhance your craft and connection with your higher self.<br><br>
          -Before using crystals please be aware of their properties and how to properly cleanse them.
          <br><br>
          -Some crystals do not need to or should not be cleansed.<br><br>
          -On the contrary to the old wives tale you can buy your own Tarot deck.<br><br>
          -Oracle cards exist now but dont follow a system like traditional Tarot.<br><br>
          -You may even create your own oracle cards! </em>
